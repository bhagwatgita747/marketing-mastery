# Milestones & Feature Backlog

> Feature tracking and prioritized backlog.
> Auto-organized by: dependencies → architecture impact → complexity.
> Say "add X to milestones" to add new ideas.

## Completed Milestones

| # | Milestone | Completed | Notes |

## In Progress

## Up Next (Prioritized)

> Auto-organized by: dependencies → architecture → complexity

| # | Feature | Why This Order | Complexity | Status |
|---|---------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Fill in project context | Foundation for all other work | Low | Ready |
| 2 | Run first architecture audit | Baseline for tracking improvements | Low | Ready |

## Ideas Backlog

## Priority Rules

When adding features, they are auto-organized by:

| Priority | Type | Examples |
|----------|------|----------|
| 1 (highest) | **Blockers** | Features that other features depend on |
| 2 | **Architecture fixes** | Tech debt, duplicate code, missing types |
| 3 | **Security/Stability** | Rate limiting, error handling, validation |
| 4 | **Small features** | UI improvements, quick wins |
| 5 | **Large features** | New functionality requiring design |
| 6 (lowest) | **Nice-to-haves** | Polish, animations, optional enhancements |

## How to Use

| You Say | I Do |
|---------|------|
| "Add X to milestones" | Add to backlog, auto-organize by priority |
| "Prioritize milestones" | Re-sort Up Next based on current state |
| "What's next?" | Show top item from Up Next |
| "Start working on X" | Move to In Progress |
| "X is done" | Move to Completed with date |
