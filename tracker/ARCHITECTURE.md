## How to Run an Audit

When starting an audit, check:

1. **Dead Code**: Search for unused exports, imports, files
2. **Duplicates**: Look for repeated code patterns
3. **Folder Structure**: Any files in wrong places?
4. **Naming**: Any inconsistent patterns?
5. **Function Size**: Any functions > 50 lines?
6. **Error Handling**: Are boundaries covered?
7. **Config**: Any hardcoded values that should be config?
8. **Types**: Are data shapes documented?

Update scores and date after each audit.
